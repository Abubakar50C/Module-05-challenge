# Module-05-challenge

## I am making a very basic calendar app for the work day where it is possible to save events that the user may have planned or past!
The goal is to make the app user friendly and accessible to a wide range of users.

- My motivation for building this project was to expland my knowledge on the different ways to code dynamically updating time and dates.

  
- I built this project to test myself and see how far my outside of class learening hgas brang me. I am putting significantly more effort into this assignment
- and I want to see how this style of learning will pay off.

- It solves many potential problems but one significant problem it solves is people losing track of tasks during the work day. These tasks could be potientally very
- important and stressed working man may easily forget to do some things. Hopefully the user finds this issue resolved.

- ##Installation

- Just opening the gtihub link should display my repository and a live link should be able to load my application on any machine.
